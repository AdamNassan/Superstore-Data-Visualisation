## 📘 Introduction

This project is an executive-focused Tableau dashboard built to analyze the Superstore dataset. It provides a strategic, high-level view of business performance so leaders can quickly find trends, compare KPIs, and make data-driven decisions without manual comparisons.

Primary goals:

- Present clear KPI cards and an intuitive visual hierarchy
- Surface year-over-year (YoY) and monthly trends by segment
- Highlight top-performing categories and sub-categories
- Maintain an accessible, color-conscious design for executive consumption

## ✅ Dashboard Objectives

The dashboard delivers an at-a-glance overview of the business through:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  - Revenue (2018)
  - Profit (2018)
  - Profit Ratio (2018)
  - Units Sold (2018)
- Performance insights by customer segment (Corporate / Consumer / Home Office)
- YoY and monthly trends for the current year
- Category- and sub-category-level performance, including top sub-categories by segment

The layout is optimized for fast comparisons and decision-critical insight.

## 🗂 Dataset

The dashboard uses the Superstore dataset (included in the project resources). Key data elements include:

- Orders and order line details
- Customer segments
- Products, categories & sub-categories
- Sales, profit, discounts, shipping and date fields

## 🛠 Project Steps & Approach

- Data analysis and preparation to support KPIs and trend views
- Built top-level KPI cards (BANs) for rapid orientation
- Created YoY and monthly trend visualizations segmented by customer type
- Designed category and sub-category performance views
- Applied consistent font hierarchy and alignment guides
- Used targeted color and conditional formatting to emphasize important changes
- Added contextual helper text and data refresh notes

## 🎨 Design Principles

Color and typography choices were deliberate to improve clarity and accessibility.

- Color-Confusion Conscious
  - High contrast
  - Minimal palette
  - Highlight colors used sparingly for emphasis

- Clear Font Hierarchy
  - Large title for orientation
  - Medium section headers for structure
  - Bold KPI values for instant readability
  - Smaller helper text for context and definitions

- Strong Alignment
  - Grid-based layout
  - Consistent spacing and balanced white space

## 📝 Annotation & Helper Layer

The dashboard includes explanatory content and helper text to reduce ambiguity:

- Data source and refresh notes
- Metric definitions (e.g., profit ratio)
- Explanation of the sub-category performance logic
- Interaction notes (how to use filters and tooltips)

## ⭐ Additional Enhancements

- Interactive filters and hover tooltips for exploratory analysis
- Automatically highlighted top-performing sub-categories
- Conditional formatting to call out significant changes
- Hover and filter actions to keep the dashboard responsive and focused

## 📈 Key Insights (Summary)
